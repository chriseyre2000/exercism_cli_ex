# ExercismCliEx

This is the start of some Elixir based CLI tools for managing students.

It's based off of https://github.com/IsaacG/python-projects/blob/4228011608e6bc5dba630d6629fb2a69166b4ab4/exercism.org/exercism.py#L97

However I don't currently have a working Python 3 setup so have decided to implement in Elixir.

`iex -S mix` is the current CLI until I need to make it more sophisticated.
